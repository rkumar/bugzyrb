Wondering if we shoud add fields such as:

* version (of software)
* environment
* estimated time
* actual time

Version can be put as a tag. Can add estimate time, though.

Subject: project and component

Should we keep project and component as a tag or as a separate field
altogether ?

I am assuming each file is for a project, so its not a global database.
Thus component can be thought of. However, if someone chooses just one
database, then we need to make it easy to work at project level.
Perhaps, env variable.

Subject: project component version

set $use_project in cfg file
same for $component or version.
If true, then I will prompt for it in "add" operation.

valid_xx allows me to validate.
default_xx is default value used if no prompt 
prompt_xx is if user to be prompted
  - :freeform : allow any entry, if blank, use default
  - :false : don't prompt, use default if present
  - :choice : use valid_xx array to give choice to user
  - true : uses choice if valid_xx prsent else freeform

user_input() takes care of deciding what to do.

Subject: start date

currently start date goes as current time.

It's meant to be when you expect to start. (Later it can be updated with
actual start date.) Thus at bug creation, it should not really be
filled. Should we leave it blank and not put a default ?

Subject: readline for old values
--------------------------------
Date: 2010-07-08 00:22

i am using readline for some input, so i can show earlier entered values
for that column. I am saving that to a file.
Should i put that in database ?
File one, will be usable in other cases, too, but currently it relies on
current directory, and could clutter up disk. I use one file per column.
I could use yaml and a hash.

I am only using in cases of freeform where i don't have a list, such as
version, project, component.

Subject: New version of Sqlite3
-------------------------------

Due to sqlite3 no longer supporting arrayfields, almost everything had
begun crashing. I've fixed things here. Still sometimes results_as_hash
or db_translation gives an error saying columns() not supported by Array
in its own code. So i am having to set these values in each command
individually. Its dirty.
